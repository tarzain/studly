A robust, automatic clustering spaced repetition algorithm based learning library. Algorithm was developed from the ground up, not a derivative of available spaced repetition algorithms, of which there are many. Uses clustering of groups of 5 to assure each cluster is learned 100% before moving on to the next cluster.
